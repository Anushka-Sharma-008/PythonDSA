# 🐍 DSA in Python | Personal Learning Repository

A personal repository to track and document my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey using **Python**. This repository includes topic-wise **notes**, **solved exercises**, and **practice code** aimed at building a strong foundation in core programming concepts.  

I’m following the [**CampusX DSA Course**](https://youtu.be/f9Aje_cN_CY?si=9jPPOBXiSrjk3mdC) for structured learning and the [**Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) for consistent coding practice and problem-solving. Additionally, I also refer to the [**DSA with Python Course Playlist by Code & Debug**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhR2IpV1b2FwWwviBHRrR118YAaSlyhTU&si=D7FHvk0wDXm4jznu) for extra explanations, concept clarity, and more practice questions.
